Question,Answer
"How to search for a route","To find a route, simply indicate where you're going, where you're departing from, and when. Then choose a suitable route! If you need more information, you can contact drivers before booking or check their profiles to see reviews. To help you find an interesting route, we display routes that depart from or arrive near you."
"I still can't find a suitable route even after searching","To refine your results, you'll find helpful filters at the top of the search results: Trip type: Choose between carpooling and bus trips; Cheapest: We'll propose the least expensive trip for you; Nearest: We'll suggest the trip with the nearest departure point to you. Take it up a notch by selecting the <Filters> option in the search results, and you can sort by: Verified Profile: Find drivers who have confirmed their ID, email address, phone number, and are part of our trusted community; Auto-acceptance: Need a last-minute booking? Skip the acceptance process and book immediately; Max 2 in back: Want to carpool in comfort? We guarantee a maximum of 2 passengers in the back of the car; Earliest departure: In a hurry? Look for a trip with a close departure time; Departure time: Prefer to sleep in? Let us know when you'd like to depart (morning, afternoon, or evening); Lowest price: On a tight budget? Find the lowest-priced trip; Services and amenities: Onboard toilets? Verified ID? Auto-acceptance? The choice is yours!; Number of stops: Search for trips with 1 stop or direct trips only."
"What should I do if I can't find a route?","Haven't found the ideal route yet? Some drivers post their trips only a few days or hours in advance, and we're confident you'll soon find the perfect match by setting an alert."
"How to create an alert","Follow these steps: Go to Find a ride: Enter your Departure and Destination; Choose your departure date; Click Search; Your search results will appear. Go to the Create Alert button (it might be at the bottom of the results, so you might need to scroll down the page!); Are you already logged in? A green badge confirms that you've created the alert. Not logged in? We'll ask you to confirm your email address. You'll receive an email whenever a driver offers a ride on your chosen date. If you want alerts for a different date, you'll need to create a new alert."
"How to book a carpooling ride","To find a ride, simply indicate where you're going, where you're departing from, and when. Then choose a suitable ride! Some drivers allow you to book instantly, while others choose to review booking requests. Either way, once your booking request is accepted, you'll receive a booking confirmation, and your payment method will be charged. You can find the details of your booking and ride in <Your Rides>. If your ride goes as planned, the driver is automatically paid or can request their payout on the BlaBlaCar platform. Regardless of how far in advance you book, the driver can only receive payment 24 hours after the departure time. If a driver sends you a payment link via BlaBlaCar messaging or outside our platform before a booking is confirmed, please inform us by going to the Member Profile and selecting Report this member."
"Booking requests: how does it work?","If the ride you're interested in isn't an Instant Booking, the driver has 3 hours to accept or decline your booking request. If the booking request is accepted, you'll receive an email immediately with your co-traveler's details, so you can finalize the last details of the ride together. If the booking request is declined or the driver doesn't respond in time, you won't be charged."
"Can I book last-minute?","Even though BlaBlaCar is great for last-minute trips, we recommend booking your spot several hours before departure. Unreserved seats remain available until 15 minutes before departure. However, if you book a few minutes before departure, the driver might already be on the road. In such cases, it's difficult to get in touch for a meetup! If you're in this situation, quickly visit BlaBlaCar to report that contact couldn't be established in time and get a refund."
"How to book a ride in carpooling","You've found the perfect ride and you're ready to book! Depending on the listing type, you can either book instantly or send a booking request. Select the listing you're interested in, then click Continue, review the booking information, and click Book. If the ride is Instant Booking, you're all set. If it's manually accepted, the driver has 3 hours to accept or decline your booking request. If the driver accepts your booking request, you'll receive a confirmation email, and your payment method will be charged. If they decline or don't respond within 3 hours, no fees are retained, and you're free to book another ride instead. If you want to book instantly, simply filter your search to show only Instant Booking rides."
"Instant Booking and booking request","For rides where Instant Booking is enabled, your booking is automatically confirmed. If not, the driver has 3 hours to review your booking request. If the driver doesn't respond or declines your request, you're not charged, and you're free to book another ride instead."
"How to know if my booking request is accepted","You can check the status of your bookings on the Your Rides page. If the booking request is accepted, an email with your co-traveler's details will be sent to you so you can finalize the last details of the ride together. If you want to book instantly, simply filter your search to show only Instant Booking rides."
"How to pay for my pet?","If your pet takes up space or travels in a crate, you may need to book an additional seat. Also, pet owners must provide the necessary equipment and documents for their journey (leash, health record, etc.)."
"If you don't receive responses from drivers","If the driver doesn't respond to your booking request within the given time, it will expire, and you won't be charged. If a driver seems unreachable, consider contacting other members who offer rides. Keep in mind that everyone's availability varies; for example, a member might be busy with work."
"How to increase your chances of booking request acceptance","When it comes to discrimination, we have a zero-tolerance policy. If we discover a driver has exhibited discriminatory behavior, we immediately suspend their Profile. However, we'd like to give you some tips to increase the chances of your booking request being accepted: We recommend adding a profile photo and filling out your mini-bio to make bookings easier. You can also verify your identity. To do so, go to Your Profile > Verify ID and scan your passport or ID card. This feature is entirely secure, making it even easier for BlaBlaCar members to trust each other. We strongly advise having only one profile on BlaBlaCar. A positive review after a ride can facilitate future bookings. That's why we recommend using a single profile for your bookings. This way, you'll have all your reviews on the same profile."
"If the driver asks you to pay outside of BlaBlaCar","If you paid for a ride outside of BlaBlaCar (e.g., via bank transfer) and the ride doesn't appear in the Your Rides section, you might have paid for a fraudulent booking. Contact us immediately for assistance."
"Identifying fraud attempts","Never share your contact details (phone number, email address) before a booking is confirmed, and always carefully review emails claiming to be from BlaBlaCar. These could be phishing attempts if you receive an email or link that seems to come from BlaBlaCar or another trusted site. These messages are designed to trick you into providing confidential information like passwords or other email addresses, or to make advance payments if a driver offers to pay you or provide something in return for payment via a platform outside of BlaBlaCar."
"If you can't send a message to a driver","Here are reasons why you might not be able to send a message: Your message is being moderated (our team is working on it as quickly as possible!), We haven't sent it because it doesn't comply with our writing rules, Your network or connection is insufficient, The ride took place more than 20 days ago, The driver declined your request, There's no more space for this ride, The ride is happening in less than 15 minutes. If you believe you can't send a message for another reason, contact us."
"Contacting a driver without having booked","Unless you've found a ride with instant acceptance, you'll need to ask a driver to accept your booking request. It's a good idea to send a message to the driver before booking, as they can answer any additional questions about their ride."
"Carpooling for my child","All passengers must be over 18 years old to create an account on BlaBlaCar. However, if you have a child who needs to travel, you can book a ride for them using your account. We recommend contacting the driver to ensure they're comfortable with transporting minors. Children under 13 must always be accompanied by a legal guardian or an adult authorized by a legal guardian for both national and international trips. A young child should travel in a special car seat suitable for their age and size, or a booster seat if they're a bit older. You need to book a seat for both yourself and the child. Only children over 13 can travel alone with parental permission."
"Are there reduced fares for children?","A child occupies a full seat, whether they need a car seat or use a seatbelt like any other passenger. That's why there are no reduced fares for children traveling by carpooling or bus. It's the passenger accompanying the child's responsibility to ensure they have the appropriate equipment (car seat, booster seat, seatbelt adapter)."
"Can I transport a package?","For safety reasons, it's not allowed to arrange for the transportation of parcels or objects without accompaniment."
"Can I bring my pet with me?","Pets can travel in carpooling under certain conditions: They travel with their owner; The driver accepts traveling with them - this information is on their ride listing."
"How to get my invoice","Right after booking your carpooling or bus ride, you'll receive a booking confirmation email. Look for Your Travel Reservation or Your Payment Receipt for your booking in your inbox. This email is designed to contain all the information you need to request reimbursement for your expenses, such as our VAT number. If you don't find this email in your inbox, check if it ended up in your Spam or Promotions folder."
"When will I be charged?","On some trips, you can book instantly, while on others, drivers prefer to review each booking request they receive. If the ride is an Instant Booking, you'll be charged immediately. If you send a booking request, you'll only be charged once the driver accepts your booking request. Once your booking is confirmed, you'll receive a confirmation email, and you can find all the details of your booking and journey in Your Rides."
"How does payment work for the driver?","If your ride goes as planned, the driver is automatically paid or can request their payout on the BlaBlaCar platform. Regardless of how far in advance you book, the driver can only receive payment 24 hours after the departure time. If a driver sends you a payment link via BlaBlaCar messaging or outside our platform before a booking is confirmed, please inform us by going to the Member Profile and selecting Report this member."
"Payment when sending booking requests","When you send a booking request for a carpooling ride, the payment method you've chosen sets aside the money for the ride - this is a payment authorization - so that the amount is available when the driver confirms your booking request. If your booking request is accepted, the payment authorization becomes an actual charge, and the amount is deducted from your account. If your booking request is declined or expires, the authorization will disappear or appear as a refund in your account; this may take up to 7 days, depending on your bank."
"How can I pay?","We accept various payment methods depending on the country where your bank account is located: Paypal, Visa or MasterCard, Vouchers (usable for bus rides only). At the payment stage, we'll show you the available payment methods before booking, as different methods might be available for bus and carpooling trips. BlaBlaCar will never ask you for your login or payment information outside the BlaBlaCar platform. If a driver asks for information before booking a ride, exercise caution." 
"How to pay with PayPal","Here's how to pay for your booking via PayPal: Once you've selected your ride, choose PayPal as the payment method; You'll be redirected to the PayPal homepage; Log in to your PayPal account; Once logged into your PayPal account, review the payment amount and details; Satisfied? Click on Pay Now. You'll be redirected back to BlaBlaCar, where you'll find all the details of your booking and your driver's phone number. You'll receive two confirmation emails: one from PayPal and another from us!"
"Why was my account debited if my carpooling reservation isn't confirmed?","If your booking request is declined by a driver or expires, you won't be debited for the ride or service fees. What might appear as a debit is actually a pre-authorization. When you make a booking request for a ride, we place a temporary pre-authorization on your payment method for the total amount of the ride. This authorization is temporary and will disappear shortly. If the debit still appears on your bank statement after 7 days, you should contact your bank for further information."
"I can't log in to PayPal","If you're having trouble logging into your PayPal account, go directly to the PayPal homepage and click on 'Can't log in?' on the login page. Enter the email address of your PayPal account to receive a new password. If you don't remember the email associated with your account, PayPal will help you find it. If you still can't log into your PayPal account, try contacting PayPal or create a new PayPal account. Remember that with BlaBlaCar, you always have the option to pay with a credit card or receive payments via bank transfer."
"Why is there a pre-authorization on my payment method when I send a booking request?","When you send a booking request for a ride, we place a temporary pre-authorization on your payment method for the total amount of the ride. The payment method you've chosen sets aside this amount so that it's available when the driver confirms your booking request. If your booking request is accepted, the pre-authorization becomes a charge, and the amount is deducted from your account. If your booking request is declined or expires, the pre-authorization disappears or appears as a refund on your payment method - this may take up to 7 days, depending on your bank. If the debit still appears on your statement after 7 days, you should contact your bank for further information."
"Why was I charged twice 1 € for a reservation?","When you add a credit card, we may request two 1€ withdrawals to verify its validity. However, these are only withdrawal authorizations; we don't actually withdraw these amounts. If your bank account is located outside the European Union, this payment authorization may be displayed for a longer period, but it won't last more than 10 days."
"Why was I charged twice for the same reservation?","What might appear as an extra or duplicate charge on a ride is most likely a temporary pre-authorization or a refunded charge on your bank statement, depending on your location or the payment method used."
"I couldn't complete payment","If your credit card payment was declined, it means no amount was debited. First, make sure you've correctly entered your credit card information. If the payment still doesn't work, it's possible that the payment failure is due to a temporary banking issue. Try making the payment again from a different BlaBlaCar platform. If the payment still doesn't work, contact your bank to check the usage conditions of your credit card. Also, know that you can pay for your reservations with PayPal. As of now, you can pay for your reservations with Visa or Mastercard credit or debit cards. If you don't have one of these cards, consider asking around, maybe from a friend or family member. Reloadable prepaid cards are also available commercially."
"Is online payment secure?","We work tirelessly to ensure that you can enter your payment information and communicate with other members of the BlaBlaCar community securely.

If the driver cancels the reservation after confirmation, the booking amount, including service fees, is automatically refunded to you."
"How are service fees calculated?","The amount of the service fees is calculated based on the price set by the driver for their ride.

"Where to find the refund amount?","You can find the status of your refund in the Payments & Refunds section of your profile. The refund amount is sent to you immediately, but the time you'll receive it depends on your place of residence and the payment method you used."
"I can't see the status of my refund","If the refund status doesn't appear on your profile, it's possible that the driver declined your booking request and you weren't debited."

In case of confirmation, we provide passengers with a full refund, including service fees. The refunded amount will be the same as if the driver had canceled directly. In case of dispute, we'll ask the driver to provide their version of events. Our team will then handle refunds for both parties according to our cancellation and refund policy. Keep an eye on your emails as we might need more information from you."
"When to contact a driver","Before sending a booking request: you can inquire about luggage or check what's required for traveling with a pet. If you have questions, make sure you're clear about what you intend to ask. We recommend checking the trip comment on the listing to make sure the answer isn't already there.
